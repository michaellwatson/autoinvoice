<br>
<br>
5.8	The Purchaser and the Sellers expressly agree that the Sellers shall not be responsible for investigating or otherwise ensuring that the Purchaser is competent and experienced in the proper control and/or navigation of the Boat.

<br>
<br>
6.1	If construction and/or supply of the Boat is delayed directly or indirectly as a result of any cause beyond the Sellers' reasonable control, including but not limited to any failure by the builder to deliver the Boat to the Sellers, ("Delaying Event") the Delivery Date shall be extended by the period of time during which the Delaying Event operates.

<br>
<br>
6.2	The Sellers shall give the Purchaser written notice of any Delaying Event in respect of which the Sellers claim to be entitled to an extension of time:
<br>
<br>
6.2.1	within 14 days of its commencement, stating the date on which the delay commenced, the cause of it and its estimated duration;  and 
<br>
<br>
6.2.2	within 14 days of its end, stating the date on which it ended and the total period of the extension sought.  
<br>
<br>
6.3	If the Sellers' or the builders’ premises, plant, machinery or equipment shall be so damaged by the operation of a Delaying Event for which the Sellers are not responsible so as to make it impracticable for the Sellers to complete the supply of the Boat, the Sellers will, at their option (to be exercised within 21 days of the operation of the Delaying Event), cancel this Agreement by notice in writing to the Purchaser, whereupon the Purchaser shall be entitled by written election either:  
<br>
<br>
6.3.1	to take over and complete the Boat without further liability on the Sellers whereupon the Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers all sums then due, whether by way of Stage Payments or otherwise;  or
<br>
<br>
6.3.2	to require repayment of all instalments paid by the Purchaser to the Sellers and upon such repayment title in the Boat and all materials and equipment appropriated to the Boat shall revest in the Sellers.

8.1	Where the Purchaser provides a Specification other than one of the standard specifications offered by the Seller or varies the Seller’s standard Specification, the Sellers shall have no liability for any defect in the Boat arising from the Specification so provided or varied by the Purchaser unless and to the extent that such defect is the direct cause of personal injury or death through negligence or wilful neglect on the part of the Sellers;  
<br>
<br>
8.2	The Purchaser shall notify the Sellers in writing immediately on discovery of any alleged defect and the Sellers or their agent shall have the right to inspect the Boat including the right to carry out trials to enable the Sellers or their agent to examine or assess the extent of the alleged defect.

<br>
<br>	
8.3	The Sellers shall have no liability for any defect in the Boat arising from fair wear or tear, fire or accidents, mismanagement, recklessness, negligence or wilful default on the part of the Purchaser, his employees, agents, servants (including crew) or guests, or for repair or replacement carried out otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Clause 8.

<br>
<br>
9.3	In the event that the Boat, equipment or materials sustain damage at any time before delivery any monies received in respect of the insurance shall be under the control of the Sellers and shall be applied by them in making good such damage in a reasonable and workmanlike manner and the Delivery Date shall be extended by such period as shall be reasonably necessary to effect the necessary repairs.
